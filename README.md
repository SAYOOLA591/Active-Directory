# Introduction

We will explore the integration of Windows Server 2022 and Windows 10 Pro as part of this project. Our goal is to address various server challenges, including specific aspects such as power options and network settings. We will cover the elevation of Windows Server through its roles, the creation of an admin account, and the configuration of remote access. This will showcase the simplicity of account automation, the establishment of DHCP scopes, and the seamless integration of Windows clients into the domain. Additionally, we will demonstrate reachability through ping tests and lay the groundwork for a study on IT infrastructure.
